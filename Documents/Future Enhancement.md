### Future Enhancements

1. [ ] **Type Mapping and Type Conversion**
    - **Automatic Type Conversion**: Support mapping response data to Python objects using type annotations.
        - Example: Convert JSON responses directly into dataclass instances.
      ```python
      from dataclasses import dataclass
 
      @dataclass
      class WeatherForecast:
          city: str
          temperature: float
          date: str
 
      @http_get('/WeatherForecast/{city}')
      def get_weather_by_city(self, city: str) -> WeatherForecast:
          pass
      ```
    - **Custom Type Mapping**: Allow users to define custom serializers/deserializers for specific types.
    - **Validation with Pydantic**: Integrate with `pydantic` for type validation and serialization, ensuring that responses adhere to expected structures.

2. [ ] **Asynchronous Support**
    - Add support for asynchronous HTTP requests using `httpx` or `aiohttp` to improve performance, especially for I/O-bound tasks.
    - Allow asynchronous methods with `async def` and `await` syntax.
      ```python
      @http_get('/WeatherForecast/{city}')
      async def get_weather_by_city(self, city: str, days: int) -> dict:
          pass
      ```

3. [ ] **Dependency Injection and Configuration**
    - Allow users to inject dependencies (e.g., custom HTTP clients, loggers, or authentication providers) into API classes.
    - Provide flexible configuration options using decorators or configuration files.

4. [ ] **Middleware Support**
    - Enable middleware to intercept requests and responses for tasks like logging, retry logic, caching, or authentication.
    - Example middleware functions:
        - Request logging.
        - Response caching using `cachetools`.
        - Retry logic for network errors.

5. [ ] **Request and Response Interceptors**
    - Allow users to define interceptors that modify requests before they are sent and responses before they are returned.
    - Useful for tasks like adding custom headers, transforming data, or handling errors globally.

6. [ ] **Authentication and Authorization**
    - Add support for various authentication schemes:
        - API key in headers or query parameters.
        - Bearer token for OAuth2.
        - Basic authentication.
    - Allow users to define custom authentication handlers:
      ```python
      def my_auth_handler(request):
          request.headers['Authorization'] = f"Bearer {get_token()}"
          return request
      ```

7. [ ] **Enhanced Query Parameter Handling**
    - Support for query parameters, including nested dictionaries, lists, and complex types.
    - Automatic serialization of query parameters based on type annotations.

8. [ ] **WebSocket Support**
    - Implement support for WebSocket communication, allowing users to define WebSocket endpoints and handle real-time data.
    - Example:
      ```python
      @websocket_connect('/notifications')
      def on_message(self, message: str):
          print("Received:", message)
      ```

9. [ ] **Response Caching and Throttling**
    - Implement caching strategies to reduce redundant API calls using tools like `cachetools`.
    - Support rate-limiting and throttling to avoid hitting API limits.

10. [ ] **Batch Request Support**
    - Allow users to send multiple requests in a single call to optimize performance for APIs that support batch processing.
    - Example:
      ```python
      api.batch([
          api.get_weather_by_city("shanghai", 3),
          api.get_all_weather_forecast("beijing", 2)
      ])
      ```

11. [ ] **Schema Generation and Documentation**
    - Auto-generate OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation based on annotated methods and types.
    - Provide a UI to explore and test APIs directly from the documentation.

12. [ ] **Mocking and Testing Utilities**
    - Add built-in utilities for mocking HTTP responses to facilitate unit testing.
    - Allow users to test their API client implementations without hitting real servers.
    - Example:
      ```python
      from my_http_client.testing import mock_response

      with mock_response('/WeatherForecast/shanghai', {"city": "shanghai", "temp": 25}):
          assert api.get_weather_by_city("shanghai")["temp"] == 25
      ```

13. [ ] **Enhanced Error Handling and Custom Exceptions**
    - Define custom exception classes for different types of HTTP errors (e.g., `NotFoundException`, `UnauthorizedException`, `TimeoutException`).
    - Support for global error handlers that users can configure.

14. [ ] **Advanced Serialization and Deserialization**
    - Support for handling different response formats (JSON, XML, CSV).
    - Allow users to register custom serializers for specific content types.
    - Example:
      ```python
      @http_get('/report')
      @response_format('csv')
      def get_report(self) -> pd.DataFrame:
          pass
      ```

15. [ ] **Code Generation Tools**
    - Provide a CLI tool to generate API client code from OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications.
    - Automatically generate Python client classes based on API documentation, saving users time.

16. [ ] **Plug-in Architecture**
    - Allow users to extend the library by writing their own plugins for custom behaviors.
    - Example plugins:
        - Custom logging formatters.
        - Metrics collectors (e.g., Prometheus).
        - Data encryption/decryption for sensitive data.

17. [ ] **Environment-Aware Configuration**
    - Support environment-based configuration (e.g., development, testing, production) using `.env` files or environment variables.
    - Allow users to switch between different API hosts based on the environment.

18. [ ] **CLI Interface**
    - Develop a CLI tool for testing endpoints, generating API clients, and managing configurations.
    - Example usage:
      ```bash
      myclient test /WeatherForecast/shanghai --method GET
      ```

19. [ ] **Integrations with Popular Frameworks**
    - Seamless integration with Django, Flask, and FastAPI.
    - Provide decorators for converting API clients into Django views or FastAPI endpoints.

20. [ ] **Comprehensive Documentation and Tutorials**
    - Expand documentation with more advanced use cases, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides.
    - Include video tutorials, interactive examples, and a dedicated website.
